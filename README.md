# Image-Display-System
Using OpenGL, managed C (C++ transformed by Microsoft to run bytecode on the .NET framework/Windows Form), this is a very basic image viewing system that constructs a 3D image from a set of 2D MRI images and provides image manipulation on an axial, coronal, and sagittal plane. 

Credits to Divine Augustine who posted his tutorial as to how to render a single volumetric image using OpenGL with thorough explanations regarding the operations in each step of the process. His tutorial can be found here: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/352270/Getting-started-with-Volume-Rendering

If you decide to use your own DICOM files, make sure you convert them to a raw image file, this can be done so using imageJ (a Java image processing program which can display, analyze, and process images, download can be found here: https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html).

To execute the program, first download the project "OpenGL_on_a_Windows_Form". Once the download is finished, open the download
and then navigate to folder "Debug" -> "OpenGL_on_a_Windows_Form.exe"

OpenGL code located in the header file "OpenGL.h".
