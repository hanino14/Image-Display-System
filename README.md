# Image-Viewing-System
Using OpenGL and managed C, this is a very basic image viewing system that constructs a 3D image from a set of 2D MRI images and provides image manipulation on an axial, coronal, and sagittal plane.
To open the program, OpenGLOnAWindowsForm->OpenGL_on_a_Windows_Form->Debug->OpenGL_on_a_Windows_Form.exe
